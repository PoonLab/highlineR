Description: A novel visualization tool to assess diversity in NGS data. Similar to the Los 
    Alamos Highlighter tool, highlineR highlights mismatches, transition and 
    transversion mutations, and synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in aligned 
    protein or nucleotide sequences. This tool also visualizes the relative 
    frequency of sequence variants and is particularly useful for visualizing 
    sequence diversity, potential recombination and superinfection.
